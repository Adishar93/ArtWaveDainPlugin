# Image To Music üé∂üñºÔ∏è

**Image To Music** is a DAIN service that suggests music based on provided artwork. Using the power of LLMs and Deep Learning, it matches a musical representation that complements the emotions and themes of the input image, giving each piece a unique sound inspired by the visual elements. Our backend service, deployed on Google Cloud‚Äôs App Engine, processes each artwork submission and returns a tailored music track.

## How It Works

- Users upload an image.
- Our backend service analyzes the image and generates music using a proprietary algorithm, transforming the mood and aesthetics of the artwork into a fitting audio piece.
- Each song created is unique to the image, capturing its color, texture, and tone.

This project aims to offer an immersive experience by bridging visual and auditory art, allowing users to explore how visuals can translate into sound.
